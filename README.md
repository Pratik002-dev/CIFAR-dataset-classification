# CIFAR-dataset-classification
In this project, our aim is to classify the images of CIFAR10 dataset into the respective classes. For this, We are training the CIFAR dataset using CNN deep learning neural network which consists of layers such as Conv2D, maxpooling2D, batch normalisation, dense, flatten, softmax etc.
